                    <h2>Homeopathy for Menstruation</h2>
                    <p>From puberty onwards, women can often suffer from irregular, profuse, painful or absent
                        menstruation. As well as being physically painful and uncomfortable, this can be an emotionally
                        draining experience.</p>
                    <p>Homeopathy can help to restore balance in the menstrual cycle in a gentle and effective way.
                        Bloating, breast tenderness, cravings, and more can be caused as a result of hormonal imbalance.
                        Homeopathy can help alleviate these symptoms by stimulating the body to balance the hormonal
                        levels in the body with individualised and unique treatments.</p>

                    <h2>Homeopathy for Pregnancy & Childbirth</h2>
                    <p>Homeopathy is a gentle and natural remedy system of healing, suitable for everyone including
                        pregnant women and even new born infants. Homeopathy can be helpful for women suffering many
                        physical and emotional problems relating to conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum
                        conditions. Homeopathic remedies can also help women to find balance from the effects of
                        miscarriage including excessive bleeding, insomnia, exhaustion, and anxiety.</p>
                    <p>Homeopathic remedies are energetic medicines which gently boost the body’s own healing powers.
                        They are therefore safe to use during pregnancy without fear of toxicity or side effects.</p>
                    <p>Homeopathy is also suitable for helping to alleviate ovarian problems including inflammation,
                        infection, cysts or tumours. These are caused by imbalances in hormones that homeopathy works to
                        rebalance.</p>
