            ABOUT HOMEOPATHY FOR HEALTH
        </h3>
        <div class="divider">
            <p class="para1">
                Established by professional homeopath Grainne Adams in 2003, Homeopathy for Health is a top-
                quality homeopathic service for men, women, and children offering homeopathic medicine
                clinies in Dublin & Carlow and online. During a consultation with Homeopathy for Health, a
                member of our team will speak with you in-depth to devise a unique homeopathic remedy for
                your individual case.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the consultation, we will discuss a number of things such as your health history, likes and
                dislikes, the problem that you're suffering from, eating habits, sleeping patterns, past medical
                history, and more.
                <br>
                <br>
                The initial consultation can take about an hour, with a remedy being prescribed either there and
                then or in the next few days. The goal of homeopathy is to restore balance to the individual's
                body, which is why we work closely with each and every client to prescribe remedies that are
                tailored to your body and not just a particular symptom.

                    I graduated from the Irish School of Homeopathy in 2003 and have been practising ever since. I am
                    passionate about how homeopathy can bring about healing on so many levels. I have completed
                    post-graduate training under Anne Walker – Irish School of Homeopathy and Dr Au Ramakrishna.

                <br>
                <p>
                    I have done extensive postgraduate study of the homeopathic detox therapy (HDT) and I incorporate
                    this
                    work into my practise daily.

                    <br>
                    In January 2016 I travelled with a group of homeopaths to Mumbai in India to attend Dr. Rajan
                    Sankarin’s
                    school to study his method of treating.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 2007 I was invited to join the staff of the Irish School of Homeopathy to teach.

                    Having been a teacher for 20 years this gave me the opportunity to blend both careers!

                I still have a wonderful sense of honour at being able to help people who have tried so many other
                things and are still suffering. To me, it is very rewarding to be able to help people on all levels.
                I
                also run ‘Homeopathy for Home Use’ courses to teach people about first aid remedies – how to choose
                them
                and to administer them. I find parents of young children are especially interested in these courses
                and
                as a former teacher I enjoy giving them!
                <br>
                <br>
                I currently run and work in two clinics; a Dublin homeopathy clinic based in Dublin 2 and a Carlow
                homeopathy clinic based just outside Carlow town.

        <h3>What Happens During a Homeopathic Consultation?</h3>
        <p> A homeopathic consultation is quite different to other consultations a person may have experienced. A
            homeopath’s job is to allow the client to tell about themselves – their current problem, how it began, what
            it is like for them, other problems they may have whether physical or emotional. <br>
            During this consultation, the homeopath will cover things like eating habits, likes and dislikes, sleep
            patterns, past medical history and family medical history etc. <br>

            This initial consultation will usually take about an hour. A remedy that best covers the totality of the
            client is then prescribed. Lots of people may suffer from a similar condition e.g. migraine but no two
            people will experience it in exactly the same way. <br><br>

            The homeopath must match the symptoms of the client as closely as possible to an individual remedy. <br><br>


            Having taken a remedy, whether as a single dose or on a daily basis, you can expect a general feeling of
            well-being. When a remedy goes into your system it often shakes things up a bit and sometimes this causes
            physical symptoms to react before they begin to improve. <br><br>
            Often people experience far better sleep having taken a remedy and feel more rested and have more energy.
            This is the body’s way of starting the healing process. Symptoms begin to ease as the body follows its path
            towards health and balance. <br><br>

            Clients report the easing of their symptoms – ‘not as bad as it was,’ ‘not as often’ and ‘doesn’t last as
            long.’ This improvement continues until the body has completely redressed the imbalance and the symptoms no
            longer appear at all. <br><br>
            Following on from your initial homeopathic consultation, a follow-up appointment will be arranged to monitor
            the success of the first remedy, tweaking and prescribing remedies when necessary.
