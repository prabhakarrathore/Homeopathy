                            is coming from. I’ve been a regular client for over 4 years now, and if Grainne Adams comes
                            across a problem which she herself can not address, then she knows a woman or man who can
                            help. As a therapist, Grainne leaves me feeling in charge of my health, and she gives me all

                            I saw great improvements in my son Alex since bringing him to see Grainne a year ago. Alex

                            in school. Since starting homeopathic treatment Alex has transformed in that he has become
                            calm, happy and his ability to concentrate has improved remarkably. This was noticed by
                            everyone involved, family and school staff! I’m more than glad that I sought homeopathic
                            treatment for Alex and Grainne is very in tune with Alex as an individual and his progress
                            which is vitally important.

                            worked and its positive effect on all areas of my life. I have since used Grainne’s
                            treatment for various conditions during pregnancy and the post natal period. In each
                            case her remedies worked effectively and left me feeling balanced and relaxed. I now

                            three father figures, eight house moves, various forms of abuse, etc., etc., etc.
                            Over time I opened up the boxes and Grainne adapted the remedies to support me along
                            the way. She listened and guided me gently, sometimes firmly. Gave me tools to
                            change my thinking, my language and simply showed me a different way to be. Grainne
                            is a very kind lady who is extremely generous with her support. I will forever be

                            me run.

                            tissue, low appetite, vomiting bugs and muscle aches after sport. On another level
                            she has supported us through grief, traumas and teenage milestones. One specific
                            example I remember was when my daughter had a very bad flu and Grainne reviewed her
                            over the phone, every day, for ten days! When I became familiar with homeopathy, I
                            bought a little home kit and now I ring or text Grainne with the issue and she
                            advises me what remedy to use. I am so glad to be able to treat my family and I in
                            this holistic way. They have never had an antibiotic in the time that Grainne has
                            treated them! Grainne has a lovely, natural way about her, especially with children,
                            showing great patience and kindness.

                            I am a 39yr old male and have throughout my adult life suffered with anxiety in
                            varying degrees from moderate to severe. When I first attended Gráinne things had
                            spiralled out of control. I was suffering with frequent, prolonged and
                            uncontrollable panic attacks. I got immediate relief from the first remedy Gráinne
                            gave me, enabling me to relax, put things in perspective and cope better. Over the
                            following weeks my anxiety levels continued to diminish. I was no longer debilitated
                            by it. I continue to attend Gráinne monthly. She is always warm and sincere,
                            offering words of encouragement that help to redirect your focus. I now enjoy a much
                            improved quality of life and can’t thank Gráinne enough for all her help.

                            I recently attended Grainne in her clinic after I’d been extremely ill with
                            pneumonia. My whole system was completely exhausted, I still had a chronic cough and
                            any attempt at physical exercise had me back in the bed again. Grainne began
                            treatment of me homoeopathically. Within a few days my energy levels began to
                            improve and I was able to return to work the following week. Grainne monitored my
                            progress very carefully adjusting the remedies as my symptoms changed and improved.
                            Two months after having been so seriously ill I am back to full health and my energy
                            levels are fully restored. I am so grateful to Grainne for her assiduous care of me
                            and commitment to getting me well again. I cannot recommend Grainne or homeopathy
                            highly enough. Homeopathy not only cures but it brings the whole body back into
                            balance and I’d really recommend it to everyone as a gentle but powerful way to
                            overcome illness.

            What is Homeopathy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Homeopathy is a system of medicine that has been practised all over the world for almost 250 years.
            Homeopathic
            remedies work at an energetic level,
            stimulating the body's own healing abilities to help mental, emotional, and physical ailments.
            <br>
            The word homeopathy is derived from Greek meaning 'similar suffering.' This is the basis of homeopathic
            philosophy.
            The main philosophy of homeopathy teaches
            that a substance that can produce symptoms in a healthy person can cure those same symptoms in a sick person
            e.g. A
            remedy made from a red onion is often
            prescribed for somebody suffering with red, itchy eyes that water constantly, similar to the condition hay
            fever.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our bodies are always trying to maintain balance but sometimes our immune system is weakened. This can be
            due to
            various stresses that we encounter in our
            everyday lives or due to the stress that our lifestyle puts on our bodies. Whenever we are out of balance we
            can
            be
            guaranteed that our immune system will be
            trying to restore the balance to help us to regain health. Homeopathic remedies are in such minute, dilute
            doses
            that they are safe for everybody to use from
            infants, pregnant women to elderly people.
            <br>
            <br>
            Homeopathic remedies act as a catalyst to stimulate the body's own immune system to heal. As the remedy will
            match
            the symptoms of the person it's as if it
            points the immune system in exactly the right direction to speed the healing process and to restore health
            and
            wellbeing to the body.
