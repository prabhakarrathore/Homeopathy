                            <p>Spring is such a welcome time of year for most of us –the days get longer, the sun
                                starts to show its face again and the garden begins to stir. However, those who
                                suffer from hay fever have learned to dread the oncoming Spring as it heralds the
                                season of itchy eyes and nose, constant runny or blocked nose and lots and lots of
                                sneezing! Homeopathy can offer great relief from these distressing symptoms!</p>

                            <p>Hand–foot-and-mouth disease, or HFMD, is caused by a virus. While it’s not pleasant,
                                it also isn’t serious. Anyone can get the disease, but children under age 10 are
                                most likely to catch it.</p>

                                symptoms of the vomiting bug.Although it is usually short lived, the vomiting bug is
                                very distressing and it often spreads through the household rapidly.</p>
